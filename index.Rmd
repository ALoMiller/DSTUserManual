# Preparing the DST Model Run

## Example Base Run Code

To understand the setup of a DST model run, it's important to look at the basic code used to source the model code (including the version), set directories, and required model inputs. Model inputs are defined as a list object `InputList` with the required objects listed below. Finally, the model function `DecisionTool` is run.
```
rm(list=ls()) ## clear the global environment
HD="//net/work4/LobsterGroup/Management/RightWhales/DecisionSupportTool"; setwd(HD) ## set directory to where inputs will be read from 
Version="DST_V4.2.00.R" ## specify which DST version to load/run
source(paste0(HD, "/function_", Version)) ## load DST version/functions into R environment

## REQUIRED InputList INPUTS
InputList = list(
  HomeDir=HD, ## home directory for subdirectories
  ModelVersion=Version, ## model version
  InputActions=list(Name = "ScenarioName/Example.csv",
                    Source=”Wide”), ## see Section 1.2 Below
  MapRefDomain="MapRef_3.9.2.Rdata", ## MapRef version
  GearMapName = "FisheryInputs_AllEastCoast_v4.0.1.Rdata", ## fishery input layer
  ThreatModel="ThreatMod_RW_Selectivity_Uncertainty.Rdata", ## gear threat model
  WhaleHabitatModel="Duke_RightWhaleModel_v12_1019.Rdata", ## whale habitat model
WhaleVertDistInput=list(File="RightWhaleVerticalDistribution_CSA_V1.1.Rdata", Distribution="Ensemble"), ## whale vertical distribution
  WhaleDimensions="WhaleDimensions_AdHoc.Rdata", ## whale body dimensions
  CommentText = “Example Comment Text” ## comment text written to output tables
) 

DecisionTool(DecisionToolInputs = InputList) ## call DST function
```

## InputActions
Within `InputList`, `InputActions` defines the scenario or management actions to be tested. The user has the option to define these in either a saved spreadsheet .csv file ([Saved .csv File]) or within the R code ([Create List of Actions]). For this example we have named our scenario "ScenarioName."

### Saved .csv File

When defining InputActions in the .csv file structure, an Excel spreadsheet (Ex. ScenarioTemplate_V4.0.0.xlsx) is used as a starting template for management. For each line, an action is specified and can be defined by fishery, spatial, and temporal bounds. Each additional column that subsets the action can be viewed as an "or" statement while each additional line (new action) can be viewed as an "and" statement. Commas can be used when specifying multiple entries for an individual cell. In this example InputActions spreadsheet there are four management actions. The first action restricts the model run to Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank (GOM_GBK) and Southern New England (SNE). The second action implements a closure to the lobster fishery in the South Island Restricted Area for January and February. The third action implements a year round closure to the gillnet fishery in Statistical Reporting Area 514. And the fourth action applies a gear reduction to state waters.

![Example input spreadsheet defining managment actions to be run in the DST. \label{InputSpreadsheetEx}](images/InputSpreadsheetExample.png)

This Excel spreadsheet should be saved with a new name for the scenario run with the .csv file extension in the InputSpreadsheets directory (Ex. DecisionSupportTool/InputSpreadsheets/ScenarioName/Example.csv). “Source” tells the DST what format the input is in so it can read in the scenario inputs properly.
```
InputActions = list(Name = “ScenarioName/Example.csv”,
	Source = “Wide”)
```
### Create List of Actions

As an alternative to creating a saved .csv file in the InputSpreadsheets folder for model InputActions, the user can write individual actions as lists within the R code itself. These lists are then joined into a larger list of complete actions, then merge together as list of lists to write into InputActions. Following the example from the Excel spreadsheet above, we can apply these same actions as an input list in R before running the model code. In this case each action (A1, A2, A3, A4) equates to a row in the spreadsheet.
```
A1 <- list(Action = "ModelConstraint", 
           Region = "GOM_GBK,SNE")
A2 <- list(Action = "Closure", 
           Fishery = "Lobster",
           Months = "1,2",
           Shapefile = "South_Island_Restricted_Area")
A3 <- list(Action = "Closure",
           Fishery = "Gillnet",
           StatArea = "514")
A4 <- list(Action = "GearReduction",
           StateFed = "State")
My.Input.List <- list(A1,A2,A3,A4)
```
Since the DST will not be reading in an existing .csv file, the user will need to supply a directory name that will be associated with these input scenario actions (ScenarioName). For this method, “Source” is now the name of the list of lists you’ve just created.
```
InputActions = list(Name = “ScenarioName/Example”,
	Source = My.Input.List)
```
Be sure not to put “.csv” file at end of “Example”. This will lead the model to look for a .csv file within the “InputSpreadsheets/ScenarioName” rather than read your list. 

### Available Scenario InputActions

Available management actions can be found in the dropdown menu of the Action column if using the input spreadsheet method. These are listed below with details on the required dependencies (fields within the input spreadsheet) associated with implementing them. In addition to the required dependencies, optional additions exist for all actions, including `Percentage` which allows a percent of the total action applied.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
action.dep <- data.frame(Action=c('NoAction','ModelConstraint','GearReduction','GearCap','SoakLimit','LineCap','Closure','StringLength','MaxGearWSingleLine','MaxVertRopeStrength','MaxHorizRopeStrength'), Required.Dependency=c('NA','At least one spatial, temporal, or fishery specific distinction','NA','GearCap','SoakLimit','LineCap','NA','StringRegulation, StringLength','MaxGearWSnglLn','MaxRopeStrength','MaxRopeStrength'), Notes=c('Runs a baseline model with no scenario actions','Constrains fishery input and map layer to the specified fishery, space and/or time constraints. If a single ModelConstraint action has multiple constraints, an "and" statement describes their implementation (e.g. [Action = ModelConstraint, StatArea = 514, Fishery = Lobster] results in the model being constrained to only records for the Lobster Fishery in StatArea 514.) If multiple ModelConstraint actions are used, an "or" statement describes their implementation. (e.g. [Action = ModelConstraint, State = MA] & [Action = ModelConstraint, StatArea = 514] then the model will be constrained to records within MA state waters AND Statistical Area 514.)','Removes all gear from specified fishery, location, and time duration.

kableExtra::kable(action.dep, "html", col.names=c("Action","RequiredDependency","Notes"), booktabs =  TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 11) 
```

Constraints to these management actions can be spatial, temporal, or fishery specific. These are defined by the various columns in the input spreadsheet. All available options within each column are listed in the table below. 

```{r, aco, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
action.constrain.options <- data.frame(Constrain.Type=c('Area','Area','Area','Area','Area','Area','Area','Area','Area','Time','Fishery'),Name=c('Region','LMA','State','StateFed','Exempt','StatArea','Depth','Distance','Shapefile','Month','Fishery'),Options=c('GOM_GBK, SNE, MAB, SE','A1, A2, A3, A2_3overlap, A4, A5, A6, OCC','ME, NH, MA, RI, CT, NY, NJ, DE, MD, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL','State, Fed','Exempt, NonExempt','All [Statistical Reporting Areas](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/greater-atlantic-region-statistical-areas) within the US Atlantic EEZ from Maine to Florida','Positive value between 0 and 200','Positive value between 0 and 100','Applicable shapefile name saved in one of three directories: InputShapefiles/ <br> TempShapefiles/ <br> ArchiveShapefiles/','1-12','Any subset of a fishery name or names (see [Available Fishery Inputs])'),Notes=c('Regional boundaries are used for easy spatial constraint, but they do not represent management boundaries.','LMA boundaries reference [Lobster Management Areas](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/lobster-management-areas) throughout the US Atlantic.','State constraints include the individual state waters and all adjacent federal waters','Boundaries for State (0-3 nm) and Federal (>3 nm) waters.','Boundaries for areas exempt from federal regulation.

Discontiguous months can also be selected.','All fisheries containing this character string will be selected and subject to the associated Action.'))

kableExtra::kable(action.constrain.options, "html", col.names=c("Constraint Type","Name","Options","Notes"), escape = FALSE, booktabs =  TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 11) %>%

  kableExtra::column_spec(4, background = "white") %>%
  kableExtra::collapse_rows(columns=1) 
```

### MapRef
These spatial references for management actions, fishery inputs, and the DST model domain itself all utilize a gridded map containing all of these specifics referred to as MapRef. All Area constraints listed in the table below (except Shapefile) are specified for each grid cell within MapRef for each fishery and month. This allows for management actions like closures and specific gear restrictions to be implemented both within the fishery input development and within the DST model.

![Spatial domain of the DST. Statistical Reporting Areas and Lobster Management Areas shown for reference in green and orange, respectively. A map of the islands south of Massachusetts was inset as an example of the gridded cell size of 1 nm$^{2}$. \label{MapRefDomain}](images/MapRefDomain.png)

### Rerun or Modify Previous Scenario 

At the beginning of each DST model run, the model inputs and scenario `InputActions` are written into an .RData file within the ScenarioName with an extension "_DecisionToolInputs". To rerun or modify a model, this .RData file can be read back into the R environment. 
```
load(paste0(HD,"/Scenarios/ScenarioName/Example/Example_DecisionToolInputs.Rdata"))
```
To rerun the model as-is, a new `InputList` is not required and the DST function can be called as follows:
```
DecisionTool(DecisionToolInputs)
```
The user can also modify the inputs of this model and rerun by redefining elements within the. For example, to modify rerun the above example changing the fishery input layer that is used within the model from `GearMapName = "FisheryInputs_AllEastCoast_v4.0.1.Rdata"` to `GearMapName = "FisheryInputs_Gillnet_v3.5.5.Rdata"` the user would apply the following code:
```
DecisionToolInputs$GearMapName <- "FisheryInputs_Gillnet_v3.5.5.Rdata"
DecisionTool(DecisionToolInputs)
```
## Optional InputList Inputs

The example base run code provided in [Input Actions] lists the mandatory inputs required in the `InputList`. Additional optional inputs are available to the user as detailed in the table below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## Available Fishery Inputs

Fishery inputs are constructed from individual fisheries defined generally by gear type, region, and species within state or federal waters. These are combined into one coastwide fishery input (`FisheryInputs_AllEastCoast_v4.0.1.Rdata`) that accounts for all fixed-gear fisheries from Maine to Florida. The user can define the fishery input to be run in the DST with the `Gearmap` object in the `InputList` ([Example Base Run Code]). Individually built subgroups that made up this coastwide fishery input can also be specified if the user isn't interested in running the DST on all coastwide fixed-gear fisheries. Understanding these subgroups is also useful for applying management actions since any text used in the filename can be supplied in the Fishery column as a text string to subset the action, applying it only to those fisheries.

![List of unique fishery inputs that make up `FisheryInputs_AllEastCoast_v4.0.1.Rdata`.](images/ListOfIndividualFisheryInputs.png)

# Inside the DST: Initial Load and Configure
To begin a scenario run of implemented management actions in the DST, begin by generating the `InputList` with either the Excel input spreadsheet ([Saved .csv File]) or within the R code ([Create List of Actions]) and configuring the user options. The flow chart below describes the process the model takes for implementing management actions, specifically which actions affect various gear quantifications and modifications.

![The DST model has a modular design made up of various fishery and whale inputs (in dark blue), with a number of submodels (light blue headers) used to carry out calculations and transformations that are imposed by management actions (white exterior arrows) that eventually lead to resulting risk estimates.](images/FlowChart012723-04.png)

## Read Input List
The DST identifies all model run variables that have been specified and assigns default values for those that have not been specified. A subfolder is generated (if it doesn't already exist from a previous duplicated run). In our example from the above section, [InputActions], the subfolder is named 'ScenarioName.' The DST determines the structure of InputActions (the .csv file or R list) and begins unlisting the provided InputActions.

## Load Data
The DST then loads in the following data inputs:

 - Fishery Input Layer
 - Whale Density Layer
 - Whale Vertical Distribution Layer
 - Whale Body Dimensions
 - Threat Model

If any of these input files do not exist in the expected directory, the model will end and report an error that the specified file was not found. The model also checks for the four required elements within the fishery input layer (GearMap, GearPerString, CumulativeEffort, and LineStrength). Any missing shapefiles specified in the `InputActions` (see Table on constraints for actions in the [Available Scenario InputActions] section) will also prevent the DST from moving on to model calculation stages. The following section ([Inside the DST: Model Stages]) will lay out the order of model stages and discuss each in detail. 

# Inside the DST: Model Stages
